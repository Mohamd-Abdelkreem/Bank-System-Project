# Bank System Project

This repository contains the final project developed as part of a comprehensive course on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and file management. Over the course of multiple video lessons, we built a complete bank system that demonstrates real-world application of OOP concepts and persistent data storage using files.

## Overview

The course is structured into several key modules:
- **Utility Library:** Establishing core functions and utilities to support the project.
- **Input & Validation Library:** Ensuring robust input handling and data validation.
- **Bank System Core:** Building the essential features for managing clients and user accounts.
- **User Interface (UI):** Creating menu-driven screens for client management, transactions, and user administration.
- **Advanced Extensions:** Adding functionalities such as login permissions, transaction logs, data encryption, and system security measures.

## Project Features

### Client Management
- **Find, Add, Update, and Delete Clients:** Seamless client operations.
- **List Clients & Calculate Total Balances:** View all clients and their associated balances.

### User Management
- **Login/Logout System:** Secure authentication with role-based permissions.
- **User CRUD Operations:** Add, update, delete, and search for users.
- **Permission Application:** Control access to different system functionalities.

### Transactions & Security
- **Deposits & Withdrawals:** Handle basic banking transactions.
- **Transaction Logs:** Maintain records of all transactions, transfers, and login attempts.
- **System Extensions:**
  - Locking the system after multiple failed login attempts.
  - Encrypting sensitive data (such as passwords) in files.
  - Managing transfers with a dedicated log and UI screen.

### Utility & Input Validation Libraries
- Provide shared functions for:
  - General utilities across the system.
  - Robust input handling and error checking to ensure data integrity.
